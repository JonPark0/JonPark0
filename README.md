## What I work on

**CAD/CAM and Mechanical Design**  
I use Autodesk Inventor, Fusion, Siemens NX, PTC Onshape, and Blender depending on the project. Most of my design work involves preparing parts for manufacturing or simulation.

**Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM)**  
I design components with 3D printing constraints in mind, and I've built custom printers suited for specific materials like metals and polymers, or constrained environments like low temperature or high vibration. I co-authored a conference paper on an ontology database for additive manufacturing processes:

**Web Development**  
I build full-stack web applications, preferring TypeScript with React and packaging everything with Docker Compose. I've developed and currently maintain several client sites.

**Self-hosted Infrastructure**  
I run a home server with a dedicated network setup and host my own services, including a personal Forgejo instance at [git.palnarium.com](https://git.palnarium.com) for version control and data sovereignty.
